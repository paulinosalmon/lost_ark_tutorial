# Lost Ark Game Access Tutorial

### I. Account Creation
- A US Steam Account is needed beforehand since Lost Ark does not have any SEA servers. Searching it on the Steam Store using your SEA account will not yield any results. You will mosty likely have to create a new, alternate account.
- To create a new Steam account, you will need to have create a burner/new email. Create it via Yahoo Mail, Google Mail, or whichever service you want.
- Also download your preferred VPN service, I recommend [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/download). You can also use any other VPNs like Softether. Note that **you will only need to turn your VPN during account creation. There is no need to use it after**. You can download the game on Steam and play it without any VPNs.
- After creating a new email and downloading a VPN, proceed to https://store.steampowered.com/join to create your new Steam Account.
- During this part, DO NOT TURN ON YOUR VPN YET. It will restrict you from proceeding.

- Key in your email, lock in your region as **United States**, and answer the captcha.
- Steam will then ask you to verify your keyed in email. Proceed to your inbox to complete this.

- Next, Steam will ask you for a permanent IGN as well as your password. **Now this is where you will turn on your VPN. Select a US based server and connect to it before submitting your password.**

- To check if all went well and you did everything correctly, try searching for Lost Ark in the Steam Store. If it shows up, then it's download time.

### II. Purchases
- As a Free to Play game, it will definitely have a lot of microtransactions to support the devs. One of the first purchases of the games is the involvement of Founders packs.
- Since we're technically using a US Steam Account based on SEA, **it is very important that you stay consistent with your checkout details or YOU WILL GET YOUR ACCOUNT BANNED**.
- I say this because upon checkout of an item you wish to buy, Steam will ask you for a region, and **you are charged differently for a product depending on a region**. Some may have taxes, etc. If you decide to buy in California, for example, in your first ever purchase, you also have to buy in California for all your succeeding purchases. This is to prevent Steam from accusing that you're only region switching to find out which country charges you the lowest for your product.
